CPP-Coda-Logics
===============

My c++ codes for time pass.....

1) warehouse :- Some puzzle related to graphs.

2) polymorphism in c : A sad implementation of virtual table that in done behind the scenes in C++ in C. 
                       File is still a cpp file because of ease of writing it in C++.
